# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project was to create a dynamic webpage that would display data from UFO sightings across the US. The webpage for the modules had a button that would filter the data by date. The purpose of the challenge was to add filters for city, state, country, and shape. In the final webpage, there was no search button and the webpage automatically updated when one presses enter on the keyboard after populating the filter fields.
### Resources
Java Script, VS Code, HTML

## Results
When you open the website one is greeted by an intro that depicts a picture of the globe and a text paragraph about aliens. The webpage itself is stylized with CSS and one is able to make many changes to the website if they choose. We created a storyboard for the site when we first started the module which gave us the plans for how we wanted to format the site.

I think that the bottom of the website is much more interesting because it's the part that actually has the meat and potatoes. On the left hand side of the site you can see that there are 5 filter catagories. One is able to filter the data by date, city, state, country, and shape. The infomation provided from the searches include a date, city, state, country, shape duration, and discription of the alien encounter.

As it can be seen from the image below, I chose to filter the search by state typing in the abbreviation for Arkansas "ar". There is one report from Benton.
